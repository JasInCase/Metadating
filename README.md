This repository contains both the frontend and backend for the metadating web app.

Both of these can be run while in the metadating-frontend directory.

Within that directory, you can run the following commands:

> yarn start
-- Runs the frontend of the webapp

> yarn start-api
-- Runs the Flask backend for the webapp. It is accessible at /api/v1/

> yarn start-all
-- Runs both the frontend and backend in parallel.
